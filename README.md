    Growing Snake: The snake grows longer with each piece of food it consumes.
    Score System: Points are awarded for each food item the snake eats.
    Game Over Conditions: The game ends if the snake runs into a wall or itself.
    Restart Option: Easily restart the game after a game over to try for a higher score.
